## Description

For my first project, I decided to make Space Invade-ish! A simple browser-based,
top-down shooter game inspired by the arcade classic, Space Invaders! I figured
this game would be a fun challenge to make using what we've learned in class,
and in the end I learned a lot more about creating and animating elements using
HTML's built-in Canvas. The player and character elements were drawn by me so I
felt that was a fun way to put a personal touch on the game.
